# Diffusion coefficient

Today, Fick's Laws form the core of our understanding of diffusion in solids, liquids, and gases (in the absence of bulk fluid motion in the latter two cases).

> When a diffusion process does not follow Fick's laws (which happens in cases of diffusion through _porous media_ and diffusion of swelling penetrants, among others), it s referred to as _non-Fickian_.


## Macroscopic measurement
Diffusion coefficient has units of [$\text{m}^2/\text{s}$] and can be calculated using the following equation

$$
D = J/\big(\frac{dn}{dx}\big),
$$

where $n$ is the particle density and $J$ is the particle flow density (number of particles passing through unit surface per unit time).
